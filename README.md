# Learning jQuery? 🥇

## [Introduction jQuery]

-   Live Demo using jQuery 💥: https://hilarious-snickerdoodle-05fe6a.netlify.app

## In this Repo the tools I used were:

```
1️⃣ JavaScript
2️⃣ HTML
3️⃣ CSS
4️⃣ jQuery
```

# The structure of the project is as follows:

## - I separated each topic into folders to be able to access the topics that interest me to review more easily.

## - In each folder you will find the .js files where there will be theory and practice of each topic. You also find the files index.html and styles.css

## - I left very specific comments in each code to identify everything much better and to know what each function does in the code.

## - There are also small exercises where we apply everything learned.

## - I'll leave some `Demos` at the top of this README.rd feel free to interact with them.

THAT'S IT YOU'RE READY TO WORK WITH jQuery UI LIBRARY !!! 🔸

# You can directly interact with these interactions in the `jquery-ui` folder in the code and see how to implement them as well.

# Feel free to clone the repo, I'll be happy if you practice your knowledge from this source. 💯

# A little advice for you ❗❗❗

## I usually use "Prettier" to improve my code and make it look cleaner. It is also super useful for those who are starting to program. I know that when we are beginners in writing code, we usually make mistakes or our code looks messier and we can't read it ourselves.

# Prettier definition

## `Prettier` offers support for multiple languages and frameworks. What `Prettier` offers is to take your code and "re-format" it based on the defined settings thus maintaining a consistent style. Making it much more readable and without worrying about how you write it initially.
